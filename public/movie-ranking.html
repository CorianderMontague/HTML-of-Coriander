<h1>The Best Movies According to Coriander</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time*</h2>

<hr />

<h3>The Cabin in the Woods</h3>
<p>It's a really cool blend of horror movie tropes and comedy.</p>

<h3>Mirrors</h3>
<p>I have never watched the second one, but the first one was pretty good and has some cool death scenes.</p>

<h3>The Babadook</h3>
<p>FINALLY a horror movie that has a way to "defeat" the big bad, but with a neat twist that feels like it covers both possible horror movie ending cliches.</p>

<p>*Not actually my top 3 movies, just 3 movies that I enjoyed watching and likely will never watch again because they don't have a ton of rewatch value imho.</p>
